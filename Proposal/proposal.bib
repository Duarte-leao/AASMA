	abstract = {A new coordination control is developed in this paper for multiple non-holonomic robots in a competitive manner for target tracking with limited communications. In this proposed control approach, only winners of the competition are allocated the task and activated to move towards the target. A distributed coordination model is proposed and its stability is proved in theory. Inspired by the besieging behaviors in social animals for predating, an effective strategy to handle the situation with higher target speed than trackers is also proposed and verified to be extraordinarily effective.},

	abstract = {Flocking control of multiple agents with their point-mass models has been extensively studied. However, flocking control of mobile robots with full dynamic models is challenging research due to nonhonolomic nature. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed flocking control of nonholonomic mobile robots by bounded feedback. The flocking control objectives include velocity consensus, collision avoidance, and cohesion maintenance among mobile robots. A flocking protocol which is based on the neighborhood information of mobile robots is constructed by means of control design. A Lyapunov-like function and graph theory are employed for convergence analysis. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed flocking control scheme.},

	abstract = {It is necessary for a mobile robot or even a multi-robot team to be able to efficiently plan a path from its starting or current location to a desired goal location. This is a trivial task when the environment is static. However, the operational environment of the robot is rarely static, and it often has many moving obstacles. The robot may encounter one, or many, of these unknown and unpredictable moving obstacles. The robot will need to decide how to proceed when one of these obstacles is obstructing its path. In this article, a new method of dynamic replanning is proposed to allow the robot to efficiently plan a path in such complex environments. Our proposed replanning method is based on an extended rapidly exploring random tree. The robot will modify its current plan when unknown random moving obstacles obstruct the path. We extend the proposed replanning method to multi-robot scenarios in which the ability to share path planning and search tree information is valuable. An efficient method of node sharing is proposed to allow the multi-robot team to quickly develop path plans. Various experimental results in both single and multi-robot scenarios show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

	abstract = {Multiagent coordination is highly desirable with many uses in a variety of tasks. In nature, the phenomenon of coordinated flocking is highly common with applications related to defending or escaping from predators. In this article, a hybrid multiagent system that integrates consensus, cooperative learning, and flocking control to determine the direction of attacking predators and learns to flock away from them in a coordinated manner is proposed. This system is entirely distributed requiring only communication between neighboring agents. The fusion of consensus and collaborative reinforcement learning allows agents to cooperatively learn in a variety of multiagent coordination tasks, but this article focuses on flocking away from attacking predators. The results of the flocking show that the agents are able to effectively flock to a target without collision with each other or obstacles. Multiple reinforcement learning methods are evaluated for the task with cooperative learning utilizing function approximation for state-space reduction performing the best. The results of the proposed consensus algorithm show that it provides quick and accurate transmission of information between agents in the flock. Simulations are conducted to show and validate the proposed hybrid system in both one and two predator environments, resulting in an efficient cooperative learning behavior. In the future, the system of using consensus to determine the state and reinforcement learning to learn the states can be applied to additional multiagent tasks.},
